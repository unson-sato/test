In the neon glow of city lights
I'm searching for a sign tonight
Electric dreams and endless nights
Your memory shining bright

Through the shadows we will dance
Lost in this electric trance
Take my hand, one more chance
In our electric romance

Lights are flashing all around
Feel the rhythm, hear the sound
In this moment we are found
Our hearts forever bound
