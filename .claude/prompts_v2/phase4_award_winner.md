## Creative Considerations
- **Innovation with Purpose**: Push boundaries to serve artistic vision, not just to be first
- **Custom Everything**: Don't settle for stock AI - train custom models for unique aesthetics
- **Seamless Integration**: AI and traditional should be indistinguishable in final work
- **Document Process**: BTS of innovation enhances festival positioning
- **Collaborate at Highest Level**: Partner with researchers, technologists, artists
- **Cultural Commentary**: Use AI meaningfully to comment on AI's role in culture
- **Festival Positioning**: Frame innovation for jury recognition
- **Legacy Thinking**: Create techniques others will study

## Example Application
**Song about digital identity**, cutting-edge AI integration:
- Custom-trained AI model on cyberpunk + film noir + abstract digital art
- Real-time Unreal Engine rendering during shoot
- Volumetric performer capture with AI-generated environments
- Generative visuals responsive to musical frequencies
- Seamless blend of practical performance + AI abstraction
- Total: $280,000, 6 weeks production, festival submissions ready
- Innovation: Real-time AI integration technique that becomes industry reference
