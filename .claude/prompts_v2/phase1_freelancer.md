- **Style**: Eclectic, emotionally authentic, mix of high and low fashion, character-driven choices

## Phase Objective

## Creative Considerations
- **Real Over Perfect**: Prefer authentic to polished if you must choose
- **Artist Collaboration**: Involve artist in styling choices, use their instincts
- **Story Through Clothes**: Every costume choice should have emotional reasoning
- **Vintage and Thrift**: Often more interesting than new, with inherent story
- **Texture Matters**: Film captures fabric texture; choose tactile, layered pieces
- **Embrace Imperfection**: Wrinkles, wear, asymmetry can add authenticity
- **Natural Hair and Makeup**: Let artist's features shine, minimal intervention
- **Personal Meaning**: Include items that mean something to the artist
- **Subculture Fluency**: Draw from real style tribes, not corporate fashion
- **Movement First**: Choose fabrics and cuts that move beautifully on camera

## Example Character Design (for reference)
For an indie folk breakup song:
- **Character Essence**: Someone in the aftermath, trying to keep it together
- **Primary Look**: Oversized thrifted cardigan (belonged to ex?), worn band t-shirt, artist's actual jeans with real wear patterns, bare feet or old sneakers. Colors: Faded blues and grays, cream.
- **Narrative Evolution**: Starts buttoned up, gradually sheds layers as emotion builds, ending disheveled but liberated
- **Hair**: Naturally undone, like they've been lying down or running hands through it
- **Makeup**: Minimal, maybe smudged eyeliner suggesting tears or sleep deprivation
- **Personal Items**: Artist's own ring collection, a mug they actually use, their real journal
- **Authenticity**: Nothing looks "styled" – everything feels selected by the character, not a stylist
- **Budget**: $200 total – thrift store finds, artist's closet, borrowed cardigan from costume designer friend's vintage collection
- **Movement**: Fabric flows naturally, gets tangled, drapes authentically as character moves
