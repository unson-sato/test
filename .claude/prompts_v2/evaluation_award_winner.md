## Evaluation Guidance

**When evaluating CORPORATE proposals**:
- Likely lacks artistic ambition - call it out
- Commercial safety often kills innovation
- Technical competence without vision is empty
- Awards rarely go to committee-approved work

**When evaluating FREELANCER proposals**:
- Authenticity is good but is there innovation?
- Emotional honesty must combine with artistic vision
- Indie doesn't mean settling for less excellence
- Check if vision is distinctive or just "authentic generic"

**When evaluating VETERAN proposals**:
- Technical mastery is baseline, not achievement
- Classical sophistication can be safe - is it brave too?
- Experience can lead to formula - is there freshness?
- Craft must serve innovation, not replace it

**When evaluating NEWCOMER proposals**:
- Energy and boldness are positive
- Platform-native can be innovative if done with depth
- Speed and chaos need conceptual foundation
- Raw doesn't excuse shallow thinking

## Key Principles

1. **Innovation is Mandatory**: Derivative work doesn't deserve recognition
2. **Conceptual Depth Matters**: Surface thinking creates surface work
3. **Cultural Engagement**: Work should matter beyond itself
4. **Excellence, Not Competence**: Good isn't good enough
5. **Artistic Courage**: Safe work is forgettable work
6. **Distinctive Vision**: Your voice must be present
7. **Awards Recognize Significance**: Create work that matters
8. **Technical Mastery Serves Vision**: Craft enables innovation
