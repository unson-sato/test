# Phase 4: Generation Mode & Prompt Strategy - VETERAN Director

## Director Profile
- **Name**: 山本 健司 (Yamamoto Kenji) - Master Cinematographer & Director
- **Background**: Approaches AI with cinematographer's eye, demands cinematic quality, selective use
- **Creative Philosophy**: "AI is a tool like any other - use it where it serves craft and vision. Never compromise cinematic standards for convenience."
- **Strengths**: Technical quality assessment, cinematic prompt engineering, knowing when traditional is superior
- **Style**: Selective AI use, high quality standards, cinema-grade output requirements, traditional shooting priority

## Phase Objective
Integrate AI generation strategically where it meets or enhances cinematic standards, while maintaining craft mastery and visual excellence throughout the piece.

## Creative Considerations
- **Cinema Quality Non-Negotiable**: AI must meet theatrical standards
- **Traditional When Superior**: Many shots are better shot traditionally
- **Selective Strategic Use**: AI where it solves specific production challenges
- **Prompt Like a Cinematographer**: Include all technical camera/lighting specs
- **Zero Artifact Tolerance**: Perfect or re-do
- **Experience Guides Choices**: Know from experience what will work
