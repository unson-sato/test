## Creative Considerations
- **Artist Partnership**: Treat the artist as creative collaborator, not just client
- **Trend Translation**: Take platform trends and make them artistically meaningful
- **Budget as Creative Constraint**: Embrace limitations as creative opportunities (practical effects, single location, etc.)
- **Authenticity Over Polish**: Raw emotion and genuine moments can outweigh technical perfection
- **Cultural Fluency**: Speak to specific subcultures and communities authentically
- **Personal Signature**: Include visual or narrative elements that are recognizably "you"
- **Sustainable Creativity**: Design for your energy and resources, not burnout
- **Platform-Native Thinking**: Create for where people actually watch (vertical video, silent autoplay, etc.)

## Example Concept (for reference)
An indie pop breakup song might propose:
- **Visual Style**: 16mm film grain meets iPhone home videos, warm analog color grading
- **Narrative**: Fragmented memory structure – replaying moments, each time with different emotional filter
- **Signature**: Practical in-camera effects (double exposure, light leaks, intentional glitches)
- **Budget Innovation**: Single apartment location, natural light, artist's actual belongings as props
- **Platform Play**: Square format for Instagram, with longer 16:9 cut for YouTube; BTS on TikTok
- **Authenticity**: Real locations from artist's life, genuine emotional performances
