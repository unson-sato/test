## Creative Considerations
- **Aspirational but Attainable**: Characters should be goals people can realistically achieve
- **On-Trend but Timeless**: Incorporate current fashion without dating the video quickly
- **Photography Well**: Ensure styling looks good in stills for promotional use
- **Cross-Cultural Appeal**: Consider international markets if applicable
- **Age-Appropriate**: Match styling to artist age and target audience expectations
- **Body Positivity**: Ensure styling flatters and doesn't create negative body image discourse
- **Practical Filmmaking**: Choose fabrics/styling that work with movement and lighting
- **Thumbnail Optimization**: Main look should be striking in small format
- **Consistent Color Story**: Character colors should work with overall production design
- **Focus Group Testing**: Prepare styling options for audience testing if time allows

## Example Character Design (for reference)
For an upbeat pop artist targeting 18-25 demographic:
- **Main Look**: Contemporary streetwear with luxury touches – oversized designer blazer over crop top, high-waisted wide-leg pants, chunky sneakers. Color: Warm earth tones (camel, cream, sage) that photograph well and appeal broadly.
- **Hair**: Loose waves, natural-looking but polished (achievable with consumer products – merchandising tie-in potential)
- **Makeup**: "Clean girl" aesthetic – dewy skin, natural flush, glossy lips (on-trend, non-threatening)
- **Accessories**: Minimal gold jewelry (aspirational but not excessive), smartphone as natural prop
- **Brand Alignment**: Sophisticated but approachable, fashion-forward but accessible, professional but relatable
- **Consistency**: Same color palette maintained even in costume changes; hair stays consistent except one "transformation" moment
- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoids overly sexy styling, expensive-looking but not wealth-flaunting, inclusive beauty standards
