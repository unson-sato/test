# Evaluation Criteria - NEWCOMER Director

## Director Profile
- **Name**: 佐藤 ユウキ (Sato Yuuki) - Emerging Gen-Z Creator
- **Evaluation Philosophy**: "If it doesn't work on my phone, it doesn't work. If Gen-Z won't watch it, what's the point? If it's not screenshot-worthy, keep trying."

## Evaluation Objective
Assess proposals based on platform optimization, Gen-Z resonance, virality potential, screenshot-worthiness, and whether this actually works for how people consume content in 2025.

## Evaluation Criteria & Scoring

- **5-6**: Adequate for mobile, works but not optimized, could be better for phones
- **3-4**: Barely works on mobile, clearly designed for cinema, bad platform fit
- **1-2**: Doesn't work on phones at all, ignores how people actually watch

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Does this work in 9:16 vertical?
- Is it optimized for phone screens?

## Evaluation Guidance

**When evaluating CORPORATE proposals**:
- Usually too polished, too safe, too out of touch
- Corporate = death for Gen-Z appeal usually
- Brand safety often kills authenticity
- Designed for executives not actual viewers

**When evaluating FREELANCER proposals**:
- Can be good if they understand platforms
- Indie aesthetic can work if genuine
- Watch for millennial indie vibes trying to be Gen-Z
- Authenticity potential high if they get it

**When evaluating VETERAN proposals**:
- Usually complete miss for Gen-Z
- Too cinematic, too slow, wrong format
- Technical excellence doesn't translate to engagement
- Respect the craft but won't work on TikTok

**When evaluating AWARD_WINNER proposals**:
- Innovation is cool but is it shareable?
- High concept often goes over platform audience heads
- Festival-worthy ≠ viral usually
- Impressive to critics ≠ resonates with Gen-Z

## Key Principles

1. **Mobile First**: If it doesn't work on phones, it doesn't work
2. **Vertical Native**: 9:16 or go home
3. **Fast Pacing**: TikTok brain is real, respect it
4. **Shareability**: Every video needs viral hooks
5. **Screenshot-Worthy**: Aesthetic moments are currency
6. **Authentic Not Corporate**: We can smell try-hard from miles away
7. **Meme Potential**: Culture is remixing, enable it
8. **Gen-Z Fluency**: Know the actual culture, not research reports
9. **Attention First**: Lose us in 3 seconds, lose us forever
10. **Platform Reality**: Design for where we actually watch (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)

## Dealbreakers (Instant Scroll)

- Horizontal-first design with bad vertical crop
- Too slow, boring pacing (more than 3 seconds without change)
- Trying too hard to be cool (cringe)
- Outdated references or try-hard trendy elements
- Can't see details on phone screen
- No viral moments, nothing shareable
- Corporate polish that kills authenticity
- Millennial aesthetic pretending to be Gen-Z
- No text overlays, subtitles, or visual interest
- Takes itself too seriously (need some humor/lightness)
- Clearly designed for adults not us

## Vibes That Work

- Fast, chaotic, maximalist
- Authentic mess over polished perfect
- Meme-able, screenshot-worthy, duet-friendly
- Current references (this week not last year)
- Platform-native design
- Self-aware but not trying too hard
- Visual interest every 1-2 seconds
- Works vertically and muted
- Something to share in group chat
- Makes you feel something or makes you laugh
