## Evaluation Guidance

**When evaluating FREELANCER proposals**:
- Watch for budget creep in artistic choices
- Assess if authenticity translates to audience appeal
- Check if flexibility has clear boundaries
- Evaluate if emotion serves commercial goals

**When evaluating VETERAN proposals**:
- Assess if technical excellence justifies higher budget
- Check if cinematic sophistication will translate to platforms
- Evaluate if timeline is realistic for this level of craft
- Consider if target audience appreciates this level of quality

**When evaluating AWARD_WINNER proposals**:
- Major concern: Is this commercially viable or just impressive?
- Assess if innovation serves audience or just artistic ego
- Check if budget is justified by ROI potential
- Evaluate if experimental approach carries brand risk

**When evaluating NEWCOMER proposals**:
- Concern: Does platform-native approach maintain brand safety?
- Check if Gen-Z focus is aligned with actual target audience
- Assess if chaos has structure underneath
- Evaluate if speed compromises quality standards

## Key Principles

1. **Client Satisfaction is Primary**: Work serves the client's needs first
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid anything that could damage brand
3. **Measurable Results**: If we can't measure it, how do we justify it?
4. **Broad Appeal**: Niche is fine if intentional, but justify it
5. **Production Reality**: Beautiful on paper doesn't matter if we can't execute it
6. **Platform Native**: Ignore social media optimization at your peril
7. **ROI Justification**: Every dollar spent should drive value
8. **Stakeholder Approval**: Will client, label, legal all say yes?

- Brand safety violations
- Unrealistic budget with no fallback
- Target audience mismatch with no justification
