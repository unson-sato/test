## Creative Considerations
- **First 3 Seconds Critical**: Must stop scrolling immediately on social platforms
- **Build, Don't Repeat**: Each chorus/verse should escalate, not just repeat
- **Design for Extraction**: Key moments should work as standalone clips
- **Emotional Clarity**: Viewers should feel the emotional journey clearly
- **Pacing Science**: Know when to push energy and when to give breath
- **Brand Touchpoints**: Ensure brand values present throughout, not just at end
- **Test for Drop-Off**: Identify where attention might wane and counter it
- **Multiple Climaxes**: Create several shareable peaks, not just one
- **Platform Native**: Structure that works for how people actually watch (often on mute, vertical, etc.)
- **Call-to-Action Integration**: End should prompt engagement (like, share, stream)

## Example Section Direction (for reference)
For an upbeat pop empowerment anthem:
- **INTRO (0:00-0:12)**: Opens on protagonist waking up, dismissing alarm. Immediate energy, warm morning light. Camera follows in one smooth shot. Hook: Their confident smirk at camera. Message: "Watch this person conquer their day."
- **VERSE 1 (0:12-0:32)**: Getting ready sequence, building confidence through outfit, music, vibe. Quick cuts showing preparation. Building energy. Character: Transformation from sleepy to powerful.
- **CHORUS 1 (0:32-0:48)**: Steps out the door into vibrant cityscape. Everything responds to their energy (people move aside, colors pop). Peak moment: Choreographed confident walk, camera spinning around them. Shareable: That spinning hero shot.
- **VERSE 2 (0:48-1:08)**: Various scenarios showing confidence (work, social, creative). Different from verse 1 with location variety. Character growing in power.
- **CHORUS 2 (1:08-1:24)**: Joined by diverse friend group, all strutting together. Bigger than chorus 1 with ensemble energy. Peak shareable: Group shot in formation.
- **BRIDGE (1:24-1:40)**: Quiet moment alone, brief vulnerability, then decision to embrace self fully. Visual: Intimate, single shot, warm light.
- **FINAL CHORUS (1:40-2:05)**: Ultimate celebration - rooftop, sunset, protagonist and community, pure joy. Peak shareable: Arms raised silhouette shot that becomes campaign image.
- **OUTRO (2:05-2:15)**: Freeze frame on smile, title card with artist name and album info.
