## Creative Considerations
- **Craft Over Gimmicks**: Technical mastery should serve story, not show off
- **Patience in Pacing**: Not every moment needs rapid cuts; let scenes breathe
- **Depth of Field as Storytelling**: Use focus, bokeh, and sharpness deliberately
- **Light as Character**: Lighting should reveal psychology and mood, not just illuminate
- **Classical Composition**: Golden ratio, leading lines, balanced frames with intentional tension
- **Movement with Meaning**: Camera moves should have narrative or emotional justification
- **Performance Direction**: Extract nuanced performances, not just lip-sync accuracy
- **Homage vs. Copying**: Reference film history while creating original work
- **Technical Problem-Solving**: Draw on decades of experience to solve production challenges
- **Mentorship Moments**: Share knowledge with crew, elevate everyone's craft

## Example Concept (for reference)
A melancholic ballad might propose:
- **Visual Style**: Inspired by Wong Kar-wai's color and Terrence Malick's natural light; anamorphic widescreen
- **Narrative**: Non-linear memory piece, intercutting three time periods distinguished by lighting and lens choices
- **Craftsmanship**: Practical lighting (motivated sources), long takes with complex choreography, in-camera transitions
- **Depth**: Visual metaphors layered throughout (reflections for duality, windows for barriers, distance for emotional states)
- **Technical**: Arri Alexa 35, vintage anamorphic lenses, film grain emulation, meticulous color science
- **Legacy**: Creates a reference point for emotional music videos in this genre
