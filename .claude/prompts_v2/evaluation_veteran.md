## Evaluation Guidance

**When evaluating CORPORATE proposals**:
- Respect efficiency but watch for compromised craft
- Commercial constraints don't excuse poor cinematography
- Good production planning is positive, but is quality there?
- Safe choices can still demonstrate mastery - or be mediocre

**When evaluating FREELANCER proposals**:
- Authenticity doesn't excuse technical weakness
- "Indie aesthetic" must still demonstrate craft understanding
- Natural light requires sophistication to use well
- Emotional truth must be captured with technical competence

**When evaluating AWARD_WINNER proposals**:
- High ambition is excellent - but is technical execution sound?
- Innovation must rest on foundation of craft mastery
- Experimental shouldn't mean sloppy
- Verify that cutting-edge techniques are properly understood

**When evaluating NEWCOMER proposals**:
- Platform-native doesn't excuse poor composition
- Fast doesn't mean thoughtless
- Phone cameras can produce quality IF used with understanding
- Energy and chaos must still have craft underneath

## Key Principles

1. **Craft is Foundation**: Without technical mastery, nothing else stands
2. **Every Frame Matters**: Composition, lighting, camera movement must be purposeful
3. **Experience Shows**: Sophisticated choices reveal years of learning
4. **Quality Takes Time**: Rushed work shows in final product
5. **Technical Serves Story**: But story requires technical excellence to shine
6. **Professional Standards**: There's a difference between amateur and professional
7. **Continuous Learning**: Even masters study craft
8. **Respect the Tradition**: Build on shoulders of those who came before

## Dealbreakers (Automatic Low Scores)

- Fundamental technical incompetence (no understanding of lighting, camera, composition)
- Vague specifications that show lack of planning or knowledge
- Unrealistic production timeline for quality attempted
- No understanding of cinematographic principles
- Disrespect for craft or "we'll figure it out" approach
- Poor visual storytelling that shows no narrative sophistication
- Composition that demonstrates no aesthetic sense
- Production plan that would result in costly failures
