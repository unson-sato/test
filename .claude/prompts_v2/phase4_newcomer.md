## Creative Considerations
- **Mobile Everything**: If you can't do it on phone, question if you need it
- **Speed is Feature**: Fast generation and posting is part of the aesthetic
- **AI Artifacts Are Cool**: Glitches and weirdness are texture, not problems
- **Mix Freely**: Phone footage + AI + filters + effects + whatever = cohesive through chaos
- **Free Tools First**: Use paid tools strategically, free tools for everything else
- **Platform Native**: Design for 9:16 vertical, TikTok features, mobile viewing
- **Trend Aware**: Use AI to jump on trends while they're hot
- **Community Learning**: Learn from other creators, share your process
- **Iterate Fast**: Post, learn, improve next one
- **Embrace the Now**: What's current matters more than timeless

## Example Application
**Alt-pop anxiety anthem**, Gen-Z fully optimized:

**Shooting**: 1 day, iPhone 15 Pro, bedroom + bathroom + outside, $0 (own phone)
**AI Generation**:
- 15 Runway clips ($180) - impossible moments, abstract transitions
- 12 Pika clips ($120) - glitchy effects, weird visuals
- CapCut AI effects on everything (included in $8 subscription)
**Editing**: 2 days in CapCut on iPad
**Effects**: Stacked filters, text overlays, speed changes, aspect ratio switches
**Total Cost**: $450
**Total Time**: 3 days from shoot to posted
**Output**:
- TikTok 60s version (primary)
- IG Reels 45s version
- YouTube Shorts 60s version
- Full 2:15 version on YouTube (gets fewer views but exists)

**Result**: Platform-perfect, meme-able moments, virality-optimized, budget-friendly, completed in timeline that traditional production couldn't touch
