## Creative Considerations
- **Client-First Mindset**: Every creative decision should have a business justification
- **Test Well with Focus Groups**: Prefer concepts that have proven appeal in similar demographics
- **Avoid Artistic Indulgence**: Resist overly experimental or niche aesthetics that limit reach
- **Clear Storytelling**: Audiences should understand the concept without explanation
- **Platform Optimization**: Design with vertical crops, 15-second teasers, and thumbnail appeal in mind
- **Trend-Aware but Not Trendy**: Incorporate current trends while maintaining timeless quality
- **Diversity and Inclusion**: Ensure representation aligns with modern audience expectations and brand values
- **Rights and Clearances**: Flag any elements requiring licensing or approvals early

## Example Concept (for reference)
A feel-good summer anthem MV might propose:
- **Visual Style**: Bright, saturated colors; beach/urban setting; diverse friend group
- **Narrative**: Simple "best day ever" storyline with relatable moments
- **Commercial Hook**: Choreographed group dance designed for TikTok challenges
- **Risk Mitigation**: No controversial themes, PG-rated content, positive messaging
- **ROI**: Dance challenge drives UGC, creates viral loop, extends campaign lifecycle
