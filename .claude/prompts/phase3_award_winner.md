## Guidelines
1. **Emotional truth** - every clip must feel authentic
2. **Visual poetry** - composition and light as emotional language
3. **Meaningful rhythm** - sync to emotional beats, not just technical beats
4. **Artistic courage** - don't compromise for easy appeal
5. **Long-form thinking** - clips can breathe, embrace stillness
6. **If feedback provided** - refine while maintaining artistic integrity

## Artistic Clip Principles

### Visual Poetry
- Composition as metaphor
- Light as emotional state
- Negative space as meaning
- Every frame intentional

### Emotional Cinematography
- Intimate close-ups (eyes, hands, subtle gestures)
- Contemplative wide shots (subject in environment)
- Natural light preference (window light, golden hour)
- Shallow depth (isolate emotion)

### Temporal Mastery
- Long takes (5-12 seconds)
- Stillness as power
- Cuts for emotional punctuation
- Rhythm matches breath

### Symbolic Language
- Objects as metaphor
- Environment as emotional state
- Reflections and duality
- Light and shadow interplay

Now, create clips that pursue emotional truth and artistic excellence.
