Electric Dreams
by Neon Pulse

[Verse 1]
In the neon glow of city lights, I'm searching for a sign
Electric dreams and endless nights, your memory on my mind
The rhythm pulls me through the haze, a pulse I can't deny
In digital embrace we sway, beneath the cyber sky

[Chorus]
Electric dreams, they light the way
Through the darkness, we will stay
In this moment, you and me
Lost in our electric dreams
(Dreams, dreams, electric dreams)
(Dreams, dreams, our electric dreams)

[Verse 2]
The bass drops like a heartbeat slow, synthwaves crash and flow
In this virtual paradise we know, our love begins to grow
Pixels dancing in the air, colors blend and gleam
In this synthetic love affair, nothing's what it seems

[Chorus]
Electric dreams, they light the way
Through the darkness, we will stay
In this moment, you and me
Lost in our electric dreams
(Dreams, dreams, electric dreams)
(Dreams, dreams, our electric dreams)

[Bridge]
And when the world fades to black
I know you'll bring me back
To our electric dreams...
(Our electric dreams...)

[Chorus - Final]
Electric dreams, they light the way
Through the darkness, we will stay
In this moment, you and me
Lost in our electric dreams
Forever in our electric dreams
Our electric dreams...

[Outro]
Electric... dreams...
Our electric dreams...
